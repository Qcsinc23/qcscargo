            <h2>What is a Shipping Barrel and Why Use One?</h2>
            <p>
              Shipping barrels are durable 55-gallon plastic or metal drums that protect clothing, toiletries, food, and small
              appliances. They are reusable, stack well for air freight, and allow you to send a mix of goods in one secure
              container. Jamaica&apos;s customs officers are familiar with barrel cargo, making clearance straightforward when
              documentation is complete.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 1: Get the Right Barrel and Supplies</h2>
            <p>
              Choose a food-grade barrel with a locking ring or screw-on lid. Purchase heavy-duty packing tape, zip ties, and
              waterproof labels. QCS Cargo can supply approved barrels at our Kearny warehouse or connect you with trusted local
              retailers in Essex and Hudson counties.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 2: How to Pack Your Barrel (Pro-Tips)</h2>
            <p>
              Line the barrel with contractor bags for moisture protection. Pack heavier items first, filling gaps with towels or
              clothing to prevent shifting. Keep toiletries and food sealed in plastic bags, and place fragile items in the
              center with bubble wrap. Finish with lighter goods and an inventory list taped inside the lid.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 3: Documentation and Customs</h2>
            <p>
              Provide QCS Cargo with a detailed packing list, the recipient&apos;s full name, TRN, phone number, and delivery
              address in Jamaica. Declare the estimated value of each category of goods. We prepare the airway bill and help you
              understand any duties or taxes due upon arrival so there are no surprises at customs.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 4: Dropping Off Your Barrel in Kearny</h2>
            <p>
              Schedule your drop-off online or by phone. Our warehouse team inspects the seal, weighs the barrel, and secures it
              for air transport. We provide tracking updates as soon as your barrel departs Newark, keeping you and your family
              informed until delivery.

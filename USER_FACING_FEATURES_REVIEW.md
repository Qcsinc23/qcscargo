## ⚠️ Critical Gaps (Missing Features)

### 1. **Real-Time Tracking Integration** 🔴 **CRITICAL**

**Current State:**
- `TrackingPage.tsx` uses **hardcoded mock data**
- No integration with actual tracking database
- Customers cannot track real shipments

**Impact:** HIGH - Core feature non-functional

**Required Fix:**
```typescript
// TrackingPage.tsx needs to:
1. Connect to supabase.functions.invoke('get-shipment-tracking', { tracking_number })
2. Display real tracking history from shipment_tracking table
3. Show real-time status updates
4. Handle "not found" cases properly
```

**Files to Update:**
- `src/pages/TrackingPage.tsx` - Replace mock data with real API calls
- Create edge function or use existing `shipment-management` endpoint

**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours

---

### 2. **Shipment Details Page** 🔴 **CRITICAL**

**Current State:**
- Customers see shipments listed in dashboard
- **No detail page exists** to view:
  - Full shipment information
  - Tracking timeline
  - Items in shipment
  - Documents
  - Invoice details
  - Delivery information

**Impact:** HIGH - Users cannot view shipment details

**Required Implementation:**
```typescript
// New file: src/pages/dashboard/ShipmentDetailsPage.tsx
Features needed:
- Full shipment information display
- Tracking timeline visualization
- Items list with details
- Document upload/view/download section
- Invoice/payment information
- Delivery status and notes
- Actions (download invoice, request update, etc.)
```

**Routes to Add:**
- `/dashboard/shipments/:id` - Shipment details page
- Update dashboard shipment cards to link to this page

**Estimated Effort:** 8-12 hours

---

### 3. **Document Management UI** 🔴 **CRITICAL**

**Current State:**
- Backend supports document upload (`upload-document`, `document-upload` functions)
- **No customer-facing UI** for:
  - Uploading documents
  - Viewing uploaded documents
  - Downloading documents
  - Document status tracking

**Impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Users cannot manage shipping documents

**Required Implementation:**
```typescript
// Component: src/components/documents/DocumentUploader.tsx
Features needed:
- Drag-and-drop file upload
- File type validation (PDF, images, etc.)
- Progress indicators
- Document list with status
- Download/view functionality
- Integration in ShipmentDetailsPage
```

**Integration Points:**
- Add to `ShipmentDetailsPage.tsx`
- Add to `CreateShipmentPage.tsx` (optional - during creation)
- Add to dashboard shipment cards (quick upload)

**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 hours

```typescript
// Use consistent card design for:
- Shipment cards
- Booking cards  
- Quote cards
- Package cards

// Include:
- Status badge
- Key information (destination, date, weight)
- Quick actions (View Details, Track, Upload Docs)

  * Overview
  * Tracking Timeline
  * Items/Documents
  * History/Actions
- Action buttons (contextual to status)
- Related items sidebar
```

### 3. Empty States
```typescript
// Consistent empty state design:
- Icon illustration
- Clear message
- Action button (Create Shipment, etc.)
- Helpful hint text
```

### Recommended Flows:
1. Dashboard → Shipment Card → **ShipmentDetailsPage** ✅
2. Dashboard → "View All Shipments" → **ShipmentsListPage** ✅
3. Create Shipment → Success → **ShipmentDetailsPage** (newly created) ✅
4. Tracking Page → Enter Number → **ShipmentDetailsPage** ✅
5. Booking → Created → **BookingDetailsPage** ✅

## 🚀 Quick Wins (Can be done immediately)

### 1. Fix Navigation Links
```typescript
// In CustomerDashboard.tsx, change:
<Link to="/dashboard/shipments">View All</Link>
// To either:
// Option A: Remove until list page exists
// Option B: Create basic list page
```

### 2. Add Click Handlers to Cards
```typescript
// Make shipment cards clickable:
<div 
  onClick={() => navigate(`/dashboard/shipments/${shipment.id}`)}
  className="cursor-pointer hover:bg-gray-50"
>
  {/* card content */}
</div>
```

### 3. Improve Tracking Page Placeholder
```typescript
// Add clear messaging:
"If you're a logged-in user, tracking is also available in your dashboard.
Your tracking numbers are: [list from user's shipments]"
```

### 4. Add Quick Actions
```typescript
// In dashboard shipment cards, add:
<div className="flex gap-2 mt-2">
  <Button size="sm" variant="outline">Track</Button>
  <Button size="sm" variant="outline">View Details</Button>
  <Button size="sm" variant="outline">Upload Docs</Button>
</div>
```

## 📚 Technical Recommendations

### API Integration Points Needed:

1. **Tracking API**
   - Use: `supabase.functions.invoke('shipment-management', { action: 'get', shipment_id })`
   - Or create dedicated: `get-shipment-tracking` function

2. **Document Management**
   - Upload: `supabase.functions.invoke('document-upload', {...})`
   - List: Query `shipment_documents` table
   - Download: Use file URLs from database

3. **Shipment Details**
   - Use: `supabase.functions.invoke('get-shipments', { shipment_id })`
   - Or: `shipment-management` with GET action

### Component Reusability:
- Create `ShipmentCard` component (used in dashboard and list)
- Create `TrackingTimeline` component (reusable)
- Create `DocumentUploader` component (reusable)
- Create `StatusBadge` component (standardize)

# Production Deployment Solution

## Problem

✅ **Signup page changes are complete and ready**
⚠️ **GitHub push protection blocks `main` branch** (secrets in Git history)
⚠️ **Production domain (`qcs-cargo.com`) deploys from `main`**
⚠️ **Preview URLs show changes, but production doesn't**

## ✅ Solution: Use GitHub Allowlist

Since secrets are already rotated and stored securely in Supabase, use GitHub's allowlist:

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Visit the allowlist URL:**
   ```
   https://github.com/Qcsinc23/qcscargo/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/34rC16sYZwdmOgYmY0rTeFlH8cs
   ```

2. **On GitHub:**
   - Click "I understand the risks, allow this secret"
   - Confirm: "Yes, I have rotated this secret" (Twilio credentials are rotated)
   - Click "Allow secret"

3. **Push from your terminal:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Vercel auto-deploys:**
   - Vercel monitors `main` branch
   - Automatically deploys to production domain
   - Takes 1-2 minutes
   - Visit `https://qcs-cargo.com/auth/register` to verify

## Alternative: Deploy Clean Branch via Vercel Dashboard

If you prefer not to use allowlist:

1. **In Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Go to Project Settings → Git
   - Change Production Branch from `main` to `main-signup-clean`
   - Save changes
   - Vercel will deploy the clean branch to production

2. **After deployment:**
   - Change Production Branch back to `main`
   - Or keep it on `main-signup-clean` if preferred

## What's Included in the Clean Branch

**Branch:** `main-signup-clean`

✅ **Source Code Only (No Secrets):**
- Enhanced RegisterPage.tsx (775 lines - multi-step wizard)
- Phone validation utilities
- Address validation utilities
- Enhanced validation schemas
- Updated CustomerProfilePage
- Updated BookingPage
- Pre-commit hook
- Enhanced .gitignore

✅ **No Documentation Files:**
- Excluded all `.md` files that might have secrets
- Only source code is included

## Verification After Deployment

Visit: `https://qcs-cargo.com/auth/register`

**You should see:**
- ✅ Multi-step wizard (4 steps with progress indicator)
- ✅ Step 1: Email & Password (with password visibility toggles)
- ✅ Step 2: Personal Info (with phone country code selector)
- ✅ Step 3: Address (country-specific fields)
- ✅ Step 4: Review & Confirm
- ✅ Real-time validation
- ✅ Auto-save functionality

## Current Branch Status

**`main-signup-clean`:**
- ✅ Successfully pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Contains all signup enhancements
- ✅ No secrets in files or history
- ✅ Ready for production deployment

**`main`:**
- ✅ Has changes locally (12 commits ahead)
- ⚠️ Push blocked (secrets in history)
- ⏳ Waiting for allowlist or branch switch

## Recommended Action

**Use GitHub Allowlist** (Fastest):
1. Visit the URL above
2. Allow the secret (it's already rotated)
3. Push to main
4. Production auto-deploys

This is the standard approach when secrets are rotated and securely stored elsewhere (Supabase Secrets).

**Time to Production:** ~2 minutes after allowing the secret and pushing.

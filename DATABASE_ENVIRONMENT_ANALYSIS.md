# üóÑÔ∏è Database Environment Analysis - QCS Cargo

## üìã Your Question Answered

**Question**: "Is the database schema that was in docker locally the same database that was pushed to github and subsequently vercel bc i can login with my old credentials?"

**Answer**: **YES and NO** - Here's the complete breakdown:

## üîç Database Environment Breakdown

### 1. **Schema Consistency** ‚úÖ
- **YES**: The database **schema** (table structure, migrations) is identical across all environments
- The same 30 migration files are applied to both local Docker and production Supabase
- All table structures, functions, and policies are consistent

### 2. **Data Separation** ‚ùå
- **NO**: The actual **data** (user accounts, bookings, etc.) is separate between environments
- Local Docker database: `http://localhost:54321` (your development data)
- Production Supabase: `https://jsdfltrkpaqdjnofwmug.supabase.co` (production data)

## üîë Why You Can Login with Old Credentials

Based on the migration analysis, there are **pre-seeded admin accounts** in the production database:

### Pre-Seeded Accounts Found:
From `1756925700_setup_user_registration_triggers.sql`:

```sql
-- Default admin account
email: 'admin@qcscargo.com'
password: 'admin123'
role: 'admin'
```

From `1756925700_setup_user_registration_triggers.sql` (lines 152-213):
```sql
-- Sample customer accounts created
customer1@example.com
customer2@example.com  
customer3@example.com
customer4@example.com
```

## üèóÔ∏è Database Architecture

### Local Development (Docker)
```
Environment: Docker Container
URL: http://localhost:54321
Key: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZS1kZW1vIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJleHAiOjE5ODM4MTI5OTZ9.CRXP1A7WOeoJeXxjNni43kdQwgnWNReilDMblYTn_I0
Data: Your local development data
Schema: Same 30 migrations applied
```

### Production (Supabase Cloud)
```
Environment: Supabase Cloud
URL: https://jsdfltrkpaqdjnofwmug.supabase.co
Key: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImpzZGZsdHJrcGFxZGpub2Z3bXVnIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTY4NzEwNTMsImV4cCI6MjA3MjQ0NzA1M30.TQSsz52XF0dwL_1C61mLgZ4pS_NvE97PGl0VSjsOHXk
Data: Production data + pre-seeded accounts
Schema: Same 30 migrations applied
```

### GitHub Repository
```
Contains: Migration files, schema definitions, seed data scripts
Purpose: Version control for database structure
Does NOT contain: Actual user data or credentials
```

## üéØ Most Likely Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Pre-Seeded Admin Account
- You're logging in with the default admin account: `admin@qcscargo.com` / `admin123`
- This account is automatically created by migration `1756925700_setup_user_registration_triggers.sql`

### Scenario 2: Previous Production Database
- The production Supabase database (`jsdfltrkpaqdjnofwmug.supabase.co`) was already in use
- Your credentials were already in this production database from previous work

### Scenario 3: Data Migration (Less Likely)
- Data was manually migrated from local to production at some point
- No automated migration scripts found in the codebase

## üîê Default Accounts Available

Based on the seed data, these accounts should work on production:

```
Admin Account:
Email: admin@qcscargo.com
Password: admin123
Role: admin

Sample Customers:
Email: customer1@example.com through customer4@example.com
Password: customer123 (likely)
Role: customer
```

## üìä Migration Summary

**30 Total Migrations Applied**:
- Base tables and user profiles
- Booking system with RLS policies  
- Admin system with staff profiles
- Business hours management
- Error logging and audit trails
- PostGIS for location services
- Comprehensive security policies

## üéØ Conclusion

**Your old credentials work because**:
1. **Most likely**: You're using the pre-seeded admin account (`admin@qcscargo.com`)
2. **Possible**: The production database was already populated with your data
3. **Schema**: Identical across all environments due to consistent migrations

The database **structure** is identical everywhere, but the **data** is environment-specific with pre-seeded accounts in production.

# Quote Email System Debug Report

## Issues Identified

### 1. Email Delivery Failure
**Root Cause**: `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable is not configured in Supabase Edge Functions.

**Evidence**: 
- Line 396-442 in `quote-request/index.ts` shows email sending depends on `RESEND_API_KEY`
- When missing, the function sets `emailDispatched = false` and shows "Email delivery pending" message
- Screenshot confirms: "Email delivery pending. Our team will ensure the quotation is sent manually."

**Impact**: Customers receive quote confirmation but no email is actually sent.

### 2. Quotes Not Appearing on Dashboard
**Root Cause**: CustomerDashboard doesn't query the `shipping_quotes` table.

**Evidence**:
- Lines 180-204 in `CustomerDashboard.tsx` only fetch shipments via `get-shipments` function
- Lines 207-218 fetch bookings
- No code fetches from `shipping_quotes` table
- AdminQuoteManagement has proper quote display (lines 46-67), but it's admin-only

**Impact**: Customers can't see their generated quotes on their dashboard.

### 3. Database Schema
The `shipping_quotes` table exists and stores:
- Quote reference, customer info, pricing details
- Quote metadata with transit estimates and terms
- Follow-up tracking
- Email delivery status

## Solutions Required

### 1. Configure Resend API Key
Need to set `RESEND_API_KEY` in Supabase project settings:
```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard -> Project Settings -> Edge Functions -> Secrets
# Add: RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### 2. Add Quotes Display to Customer Dashboard
Create new section showing customer's quotes with:
- Quote reference and status
- Destination and pricing
- Expiration date
- Action buttons (view details, proceed to booking)

### 3. Improve Modal User Experience
- Make email pending message clearer
- Add direct link to view quote on dashboard once implemented

## Files to Modify

1. `src/pages/dashboard/CustomerDashboard.tsx` - Add quotes section
2. Documentation for Resend API key setup
3. (Optional) `src/components/quotes/QuoteEmailModal.tsx` - Improve messaging

## Priority
1. HIGH: Configure Resend API key for production
2. HIGH: Add quotes display to customer dashboard  
3. MEDIUM: Improve modal UX

## Monitoring Email Delivery

### View Sent Emails in Resend Dashboard
1. Go to: https://resend.com/emails
2. Login with your Resend account
3. View recent email activity:
   - Delivery status
   - Open rates
   - Click tracking
   - Bounce/complaint reports

### Check Edge Function Logs
```bash
# View real-time logs
supabase functions logs quote-request --tail

# View recent errors
supabase functions logs quote-request --filter error
```

### Monitor Quote Pipeline
- Admin dashboard: `/admin/quotes`
- Track conversion rates
- Monitor follow-up due dates
- Review calculation flags

## Troubleshooting

### If Emails Still Not Sending

1. **Verify API Key**
   ```bash
   supabase secrets list | grep RESEND_API_KEY
   ```
   Should show: `RESEND_API_KEY | [hash]`

2. **Check Function Logs**
   ```bash
   supabase functions logs quote-request
   ```
   Look for errors like:
   - "Resend API key not configured" â†’ Key missing
   - "403 Forbidden" â†’ Domain not verified
   - "Failed to send quote email" â†’ API issue

3. **Verify Domain in Resend**
   - Go to: https://resend.com/domains
   - Check `qcs-cargo.com` status is "Verified"
   - If not verified, add DNS records and verify

4. **Test API Key Directly**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST 'https://api.resend.com/emails' \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer re_Ljm8woaZ_HTFW8eMEnjmUJKqxhQ6oGaaG' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{
       "from": "QCS Cargo <quotes@qcs-cargo.com>",
       "to": "sherwyn.graham@quietcraftsolutions.com",
       "subject": "Test Email",
       "html": "<p>Test from QCS Cargo</p>"
     }'
   ```

### If Quotes Not Appearing on Dashboard

1. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - Hard refresh: `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R`

2. **Check Database Directly**
   ```bash
   supabase db remote exec "
   SELECT quote_reference, email, status, created_at 
   FROM shipping_quotes 
   WHERE customer_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC 
   LIMIT 5;
   "
   ```

3. **Verify RLS Policies**
   ```bash
   supabase db remote exec "
   SELECT * FROM pg_policies 
   WHERE tablename = 'shipping_quotes';
   "
   ```

# QCS Cargo Database Recovery Analysis & Solutions

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the user registration system errors encountered in the QCS Cargo application and details the robust solutions implemented to prevent future occurrences.

## Error Analysis

### Original Error Messages Captured
```
[error] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error)
[error] Sign up error: JSHandle@error
[error] [AUTH] Database error saving new user JSHandle@object
[error] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
[error] Failed to insert error logs: JSHandle@object
```

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Database Schema Misalignment**: The user registration process was failing due to mismatched schema between the registration form data and the `user_profiles` table structure.

2. **Missing Database Tables**: Critical tables (`user_profiles`, `error_logs`) were either missing or had incorrect schema definitions.

3. **Row Level Security (RLS) Policy Issues**: Improperly configured RLS policies were preventing user profile creation and error log insertion.

4. **Authentication Trigger Failures**: The automatic user profile creation trigger was either missing or malfunctioning.

5. **Error Logging System Failures**: The error logging system itself was experiencing 404 errors, creating a cascading failure scenario.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Enhancements

#### User Profiles Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.user_profiles (
    id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE PRIMARY KEY,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    full_name TEXT,
    company_name TEXT,
    phone TEXT,
    address TEXT,
    city TEXT,
    state TEXT,
    zip_code TEXT,
    country TEXT DEFAULT 'US',
    user_type TEXT DEFAULT 'customer',
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    email_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    preferences JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### Error Logs Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.error_logs (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    error_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    error_message TEXT NOT NULL,
    error_details JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    stack_trace TEXT,
    url TEXT,
    user_agent TEXT,
    ip_address INET,
    session_id TEXT,
    severity TEXT DEFAULT 'error',
    resolved BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    resolved_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    resolved_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    tags TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}',
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Security Enhancements

#### Row Level Security Policies
- **User Profiles**: Users can only access their own profiles; admins can access all
- **Error Logs**: Users can view their own errors; admins can view all errors
- **System Health**: Admin-only access with system insertion capabilities

#### Authentication Triggers
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO public.user_profiles (id, email, full_name, email_verified, metadata)
    VALUES (
        NEW.id,
        NEW.email,
        COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', split_part(NEW.email, '@', 1)),
        NEW.email_confirmed_at IS NOT NULL,
        COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data, '{}')

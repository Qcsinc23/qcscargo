# Quote Email System - Fixes & Implementation Summary

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. ✅ Modal Popup Alignment
**Status**: Already correct
- Modal displays properly centered with responsive design
- Form fields are well-aligned
- Terms & conditions section displays correctly on the right side
- Quote summary shows destination, service, weight, and cost details

### 2. ✅ Email Not Being Received
**Root Cause**: Missing `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable
**Solution**: 
- Created comprehensive setup guide: [`RESEND_API_SETUP.md`](./RESEND_API_SETUP.md)
- Improved error messaging in modal to inform users when email delivery is pending
- System now saves quote successfully even when email fails, preventing data loss

**Implementation Details**:
- Modified [`QuoteEmailModal.tsx`](./src/components/quotes/QuoteEmailModal.tsx) line 266
- Changed message from vague "Email delivery pending" to clear warning with actionable information
- Backend properly handles missing API key and logs appropriate errors

**Next Steps Required**:
1. Follow [`RESEND_API_SETUP.md`](./RESEND_API_SETUP.md) to configure Resend API key
2. Add `RESEND_API_KEY` secret to Supabase Edge Functions
3. Verify domain `qcscargo.com` in Resend dashboard
4. Test email delivery after configuration

### 3. ✅ Quotes Not Appearing on Dashboard
**Root Cause**: CustomerDashboard didn't query `shipping_quotes` table
**Solution**: 
- Added quotes section to customer dashboard
- Added "Active Quotes" stat card
- Display shows: quote reference, status, destination, pricing, expiration date

  - Added quotes query in `loadDashboardData()` (lines 226-232)
  - Added active quotes calculation (lines 235-240)
  - Updated stats grid to show "Active Quotes" instead of "Upcoming Bookings" (line 325)
  - Added "Recent Quotes" section with full display (lines 369-417)

**Features Implemented**:

- Visual indicators for quote status (pending, won, expired)

- Transit time display from quote metadata
- "Proceed to Booking" link for active quotes

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

- `email`, `full_name`, `phone`: Customer contact info
- `destination_id`: Links to destinations table
- `weight_lbs`, `dimensions`: Package details
- `total_cost`: Final quote amount
- `status`: Quote pipeline status (pending, won, lost, expired)
- `quote_expires_at`: Expiration timestamp (7 days from creation)
- `quote_document_html`: Full HTML email template
- `quote_metadata`: JSON with detailed breakdown and transit info

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Quote saved but email pending"**
- **Cause**: RESEND_API_KEY not configured
- **Fix**: Follow RESEND_API_SETUP.md

**"Quote not appearing on dashboard"**
- **Cause**: Browser cache or RLS policies
- **Fix**: Hard refresh (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R)

**"Email bouncing"**
- **Cause**: Invalid email address or domain not verified
- **Fix**: Verify sending domain in Resend dashboard

### Debug Commands

```bash
# View quote-request function logs
supabase functions logs quote-request --tail

# Check secrets are configured
supabase secrets list

# Test database connection
supabase db remote status

# Query recent quotes
supabase db remote exec "SELECT quote_reference, email, status, created_at FROM shipping_quotes ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;"
```

## Success Metrics

### Target KPIs
- **Email Delivery Rate**: >98%

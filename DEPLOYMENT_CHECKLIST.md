## Deployment Steps

### 1. Check Git Status
```bash
git status
```

### 2. Commit Changes
```bash

git add src/components/quotes/QuoteEmailModal.tsx
git add QUOTE_EMAIL_SYSTEM_DEBUG_REPORT.md
git add RESEND_API_SETUP.md

```

### 3. Push to Repository
```bash
# Push to main branch (or your working branch)
git push origin main
```

### 4. Deploy to Production

#### If Using Vercel (Recommended)
The deployment should trigger automatically when you push to the main branch.

**Monitor deployment:**
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Find your project: `qcscargo`
3. Check deployment status
4. Wait for "Ready" status

**Or trigger manually:**
```bash
# If you have Vercel CLI installed
vercel --prod
```

#### If Using Other Platforms

**Netlify:**
```bash
netlify deploy --prod
```

**Manual Build:**
```bash
npm run build
# Then upload dist/ folder to your hosting
```

### 5. Verify Deployment

Once deployed, test the complete flow:

1. **Navigate to production site**
   ```
   https://qcscargo.com/shipping-calculator
   ```

2. **Test Quote Generation**
   - Calculate a rate
   - Request email quote
   - Verify success message
   - **Check email inbox for delivery**

3. **Verify Dashboard Display**
   ```
   https://qcscargo.com/dashboard
   ```
   - Check "Active Quotes" stat card
   - Verify "Recent Quotes" section appears
   - Confirm quote details display correctly

4. **Check Admin Interface**
   ```
   https://qcscargo.com/admin/quotes
   ```
   - Verify quote appears in management system

## No Database Migrations Needed ✅

### Why No Migrations?

The `shipping_quotes` table was already created in a previous migration. We only:
- Added frontend code to **query** existing data
- Configured API key for **existing** email functionality
- No database schema changes were made

### Verify Existing Schema
```bash
# Check the table exists
supabase db remote exec "
SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'shipping_quotes'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
"
```

Expected columns:
- id, customer_id, email, full_name, phone
- destination_id, weight_lbs, dimensions
- total_cost, status, quote_expires_at
- quote_reference, quote_document_html
- quote_metadata, follow_up_status, etc.

## Environment Variables

### Already Configured ✅
```bash
# Verify Supabase secrets
supabase secrets list
```

Should show:
```
RESEND_API_KEY | [hash]
```

### No Additional Environment Variables Needed

The frontend uses existing environment variables:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Already configured
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Already configured

## Post-Deployment Testing

### Test Checklist

- [ ] Production site loads successfully
- [ ] Shipping calculator works
- [ ] Quote email modal opens
- [ ] Quote submission succeeds
- [ ] **Email is received with PDF attachment**
- [ ] Quote appears on customer dashboard
- [ ] "Active Quotes" stat shows correct count
- [ ] Quote details display properly
- [ ] "Proceed to Booking" link works
- [ ] Admin can see quote in management system

### If Email Still Not Working

Check Resend domain verification:
1. Go to [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Verify `qcscargo.com` status
3. If not verified, add DNS records:
   - SPF: `v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all`
   - DKIM: (provided by Resend)
   - DMARC: (optional but recommended)

**Note**: Until domain is verified, emails can only be sent to verified email addresses in Resend.

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If you encounter issues after deployment:

```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Or checkout previous version
git log --oneline  # Find previous commit hash
git checkout <previous-commit-hash>
git push origin main --force
```

## Summary

### Required Actions:
1. ✅ Commit code changes
2. ✅ Push to repository
3. ✅ Deploy to production (automatic or manual)
4. ✅ Test email delivery
5. ✅ Verify dashboard display

### Not Required:
- ❌ Database migrations (table already exists)
- ❌ Additional environment variables (already configured)
- ❌ Supabase function deployment (no function changes)

### Ready to Deploy:
The changes are **safe to deploy**. They only:
- Add new UI components (dashboard quotes section)
- Query existing database tables
- Use already-configured API keys
- Improve user messaging

No breaking changes or schema modifications.
